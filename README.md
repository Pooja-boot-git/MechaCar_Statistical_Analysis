Delioverale 1:
1. Data for Vehicle_weight, spoiler_angle and AWD shows that it has very less significance when it comes to MPG.
2. The p-value gets smaller as the test statistic calculated from your data gets further away from the range of test statistics predicted by the null hypothesis.
Values for Vehicle_length and ground_clearance are under the significance level of 5% so they have the most effect on mpg.
3. Multiple R-squared:  0.7149. It is pretty close to 1.0 so that means that Y has good correlation to independednt variables so slope cannot be 0.
4. It does give us a good picture.

Deliverable 2: 

1. The variance for Lot 3 is very high so some of the values might be quite spread out compared to mean.
2. Lot 3 does not comply by the standards of variance less than 100.

Deliverable 3:
add subset function to the T function for each of the lots

Deliverable 4:

Assume other parameters which might affect the car's mpg.
